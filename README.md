# PIAIC-HTML-CSS-Assignments

I couldn't have the time to do the HTML, CSS and basic JS assignements, because I've been very busy in my own job as a full stack web developer and managing two web applications as project lead. I'm extensive experience in HTML, CSS, JS, Vue.js, React.js, PHP, Laravel, Phalcon, Symfony, Wordpress, Blogger. The point of mentioning all this is to make sure I get promoted to the next quarter because I really came into the course for cloud stuff. I've conducted all my quizzes though.

Therefore, I'm sharing my HTML5 Bootstrap, CSS and JS/Jquery theme that I have made back in 2016. It is listed on themeforest for sale and have 46 sales. As discussed with Ameen Alam Sir, I'm submitting this as a project for HTML5 CSS and JS assignment.

Another similar project that I've recently done for my upwork client is Figma to HTML Bootstrap 4: http://easyuptime.surge.sh/

There are numerous other such projects which I can share.
